        <summary>Full Project Description</summary>
        <p>My research project aims to do a risk factor analysis for young adults with peritoneal carcinomatosis. <dfn>Peritoneal carcinomatosis</dfn> is cancer developing in the abdominal membrane that lines its organs. Aiming to identify plausible risk factors for early onset pertioneal carcinomatosis with patient data from NCDB 2004-2020 database. Main tools used were R-Studio for running analysis and univariable and multivariable logistic regression for predictive analysis. The biggest challenge in completing this project was learning how to use R-Studio effectively and efficiently in the short 10 week duration of the internship. More specifically learning how to manipulate databases correctly so as to not lose important data points or overlook potential variables/risk factors.</p>

                Currently, this is an expansive study investigating the risk factors for early-onset CRC. The analysis showed factors such as family and individual history of IBD to have high association with early onset. Notably, an individual history of breast malignancy was strongly associated with early-onset CRC.
